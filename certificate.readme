Most projects in this solution are configured to use
a self-signed certificate for debugging over https.

The launch parameter --useDefaultCert is unfortunately
not working for kestrel hosted function apps.

If you do not already have a certificate, you can
follow this guide to generate one.

1. Open a PowerShell prompt as administrator and navigate to solution folder
> cd [path to]\AzureAuth

2. Optional: Start certmgr, Certificate Manager - the generated certificates can be found in this windows app
> Start-Process certmgr

3. Generate the certificate - it will be placed in certmgr -> Personal -> Certificates, with the name "Functions Development"
> $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject localhost -DnsName localhost -FriendlyName "Functions Development" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyUsage DigitalSignature -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1")

4. Move it to trusted root - this will allow your browser and such to use the certificate
> Move-Item -Path $cert.PSPath -Destination "Cert:\CurrentUser\Root"

5. Export it as .pfx file, to allow the function apps to find and use the certificate
> Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -FilePath $file -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "123456" -Force -AsPlainText)

The exported file will have the password "123456",
which is the same as the launchSettings for the
function apps SessionService and DeveloperAuthorizer.

If you change the password - remember to update the references!

DON'T SHARE THE .PFX FILE WITH ANYONE EVEN IF THEY ASK NICELY!!!

(You can, however, reuse the certificate for any other function
projects you want to debug locally though! See the launch
parameters how to point to a certificate file).
