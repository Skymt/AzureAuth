Most projects in this solution are configured to use
a self-signed certificate for debugging over https.

Run the script "GenerateCertificate.ps1" AS ADMINISTRATOR to
generate such a certificate.

The password of this certificate is "123456" (without quotes).

To make your browser, and other windows applications, trust the certificate,
install it to the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" store.

Do this by following the wizard started by double clicking the certificate file
in the file explorer.

Don't share the .pfx file with anyone even if they ask nicely!!!
